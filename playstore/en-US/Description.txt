MythTV Android Frontend is the first Android Client fully endorsed by the core MythTV Development Team.

Prerequsites: you must be running MythTV version v0.25 through v0.27.  If you are interested in learning more about MythTV, check their web site at http://mythtv.org. You must be running Android version Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0.x) or above.

The MythTV Services API does <b>NOT</b> support live TV, therefore, this app <b>CAN'T</b>.

An External Video Player is also required.  We have done extensive testing with VPlayer and DicePlayer, but feel free to try any video player capable of playing HTTP Live Streams.

This application can connect to your backend while you are at home or on the go.  At home, the app will scan your network for a MythTV backend and auto-configure its connection.  SSH Access*

With this application you can access your MythTV recordings and stream them to your Android phone or tablet via MythTV HTTP Live Streaming.  You can see what is upcoming or the whole program guide as well as viewing your recording rules.  You can also manage your Playback Profiles so that you can raise or lower the streaming quality of your recordings depending on the speed of your network.

MythMote is fully integrated into the application.  When you use MythMote, your MythTV Frontends will be automatically discovered for you.  Simply select the Frontend you are sitting in front of.  As an added bonus, if you receive a call on your phone/tablet while using MythMote, the Caller ID information will be displayed on the TV for you.
