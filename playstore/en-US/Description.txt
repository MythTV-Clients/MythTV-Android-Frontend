MythTV Android Frontend is the first Android Client fully endorsed by the core MythTV Development Team.

If you plan to use this application, you are required to have a fully functioning MythTV Backend version v0.25 through v0.27.  If you are interested in learning more about MythTV, check their web site at http://mythtv.org.

Note that in MythTV v0.27, using the Recording Rules screen will cause a crash. This is due enhancements in the MythTV Services API. The solution is available to beta testers in 1.20.x (see: Beta Testers Wanted below.)

An External Video Player is also required.  We have done extensive testing with VPlayer and DicePlayer, but feel free to try any video player capable of playing HTTP Live Streams.

This application can connect to your backend while you are at home or on the go.  At home, the app will scan your network for a MythTV backend and auto-configure its connection.  If you want connect to the backend while away from home, check out our instructions on how to set this up at https://github.com/MythTV-Clients/MythTV-Android-Frontend/wiki/Access-MythTV-Master-Backend-via-SSH.

With this application you can access your recordings and stream them to your Android phone or tablet via MythTV HTTP Live Streaming, introduced in MythTV v0.25.  You can see what is upcoming or the whole program guide as well as viewing your recording rules.  You can also manage your Playback Profiles so that you can raise or lower the streaming quality of your recordings depending on the speed of your network.

MythMote is fully integrated into the application.  When you use MythMote, your MythTV Frontends will be automatically discovered for you.  Simply select the Frontend you are sitting in front of, and begin navigating.  As an added bonus, if you receive a call while using MythMote, the Caller ID information will be displayed on the TV for you.
