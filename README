MythTV Android Frontend

Implementation of MythTV .25+ Services API for Android.
http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Services_API

What is the Services API (from the above wiki link)
========================

The Services API is a new set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) taking the place of MythXML in MythTV versions .25 and later. It is an extremely featureful set of interfaces designed to allow one to configure MythTV, access MythTV content, control your DVR, use MythTV as a service in your own applications, and otherwise make MythTV accessible to any and everyone.
The Services API uses regular HTTP POST and GET commands, and can return both JSON and XML output by setting the HTTP accepts header appropriately.
The Services API is organized into services, which are logical groupings of APIs by their function and purpose. The individual methods contained in each service are documented on the service's wiki page.


Build Environment
=================
For instructions on how setup the build environment for this application, please see the following:
https://github.com/MythTV-Clients/MythTV-Android-Frontend/wiki/Development-Environment-Setup


Explaination of Android Permissions
===================================

- android.permission.INTERNET
  Allows applications to open network sockets.
  
  	Required to allow the application to connect to the Mythtv Master backend.
  	
- android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
  Allows applications to access information about networks

  	Required to allow the application to connect to the Mythtv Master backend.
  
- android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE
  Allows applications to access information about Wi-Fi networks

  	Required to allow the application to connect to the Mythtv Master backend.
  
- android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE
  Allows applications to enter Wi-Fi Multicast mode

  	Used by Mythmote WOL to allow waking up a frontend if it has been shut down (currently not implemented, but will be carried over from legacy standalone app).

- android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
  Allows an application to write to external storage

	Data such as that retrieved from the Mythtv Master backend or artwork images need to be stored in the applications cache area, usually on an external SD Card.

- android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE
  Allows read only access to phone state.

 	Mythmote will READ your phone state when connected to a MythTV frontend and if a call comes in, will send Caller ID information the frontend to display in a popup.

- android.permission.WAKE_LOCK
  Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming
  
  	Mythmote uses this to prevent you from having to continually power on the device in order to perform operations.  The device will dim the screen and wake up on a touch.
  	

Connecting to Mythtv Backend via SSH
====================================
If you want to use this app on a cellular network, take a look at these instructions for accessing the backend while not on the home wifi network:

Mythtv for Android and Zeroconf
===============================
Mythtv for Andriod tries to locate all your MythTV backend and frontend machines.  In order for the app to automatically discover these services, you need to make sure 
that the avahi-daemon is running.  You can manually add your backend machines, but, at this time, there is no preferences editor for your frontends.  In order to use
the MythMote functionality, follow your distro's instructions on installing and enabling the avahi-daemon.  Once installed and running, the app will be able to not only
auto-discover your frontends, but also your backend.
